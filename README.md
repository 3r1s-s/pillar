# Pillar
An archive of Pillar, a Meower client developed by [melt](https://meltland.dev/)  
meo used some of pillars original webhook code  
So meo wouldn't exist today if it weren't for melt  
Thanks melm

While the [site](https://pillar.meltland.dev/) is still live it was never open source (or it was removed)  
So I open sourced it for them
